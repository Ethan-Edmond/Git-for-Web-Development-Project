	create a pull request to your main branch.

	oh, and try to remember that checkout, add, commit and push all operate on the current directory, so be in the right one with cd

Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

	inline elements display inside of blocks of text. block elements display as rectangles on the screen.
	for ex: span is an inline element, and you can kind of use this as bold or italic in a block of text, but if you tried that with p, they would display as two different blocks of text.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?

	it's position is measured to the top left corner of the closest positioned parent and can be adjusted with top, left, right or bottom.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?

	you could use min-width and width together. you could use the flexbox model with flex-basis and flex-grow.

4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

	block: div, p, h1-6
	inline: span, a
	inline-block: had to look this one up, button apparently defaults to inline-block

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?

	well, you have margin, border, padding and the content area. padding adds space around the content, border adds space around the padding and margin adds space around the border. padding includes the background, border can be colored or styled, but margin is transparent. generally I would either use box-sizing or some flexbox stuff to fix the widths to work right.
